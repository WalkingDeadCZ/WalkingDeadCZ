- 👋 Hi, I’m @WalkingDeadCZ
- As Nick telling im from Czech im 30yo. Have no issue with English.
- 👀 I’m interested in any challange.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning .Net (Mostly Console and WindowsForm Appliactions). I would like to look at ASP too even when im more BackEnd than FrontEnd.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything small for now. I never had someone around to help me learn so everything is from YT or some Generic paied Course. Have to test my abilities agaits other (I think i not that bad, but no1 ever know).
- 📫 Easiest (And best) way to get to me is via Discord (Same nick). If you want someone who is willing invest more time and effort than others, you can count me in.
